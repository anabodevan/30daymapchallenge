The [#30DayMapChallenge](30DayMapChallenge.com) is a social mapping challenge that happens every November. This repository contains my submissions inside the `/2025` folder, organized by day. For better viewing experience, you can check out my [website](https://anabodevan.github.io/30daymapchallenge) for the codes and maps.
